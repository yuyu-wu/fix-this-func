# Fix This Function!
# The pre-written count_dollar_signs  function is broken.   It's supposed to return the number of $ characters in a given string.  For example: count_dollar_signs("$uper $ize")  should return 2 .  But for some reason, the function always returns either 0 or 1. What's going on?

# Without adding any new lines (just move existing code around), make it work as intended.
